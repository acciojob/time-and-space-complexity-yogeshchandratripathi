	<h1>Time ,Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p> Efficient In computer science, the time complexity is the
		computational complexity that describes
		the amount of computer time it takes
		to run an algorithm. Time complexity
		is commonly estimated by counting the 
		number of elementary operations performed
		by the algorithm, supposing that each 
		elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations
		performed by the algorithm are taken to 
		be related by a constant factor
		 The algorithm that performs the task in the 
		smallest number of operations is considered the 
		most efficient one in
		terms of the time complexity.</p>
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to
		the total amount of memory space used by an 
		algorithm/program, including the space of input
		values for execution. Calculate the space occupied
		by variables in an algorithm/program to determine 
		space complexity. However, people 
		frequently confuse Space-complexity
		with auxiliary space.<br>
	    O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly 
		proportional to the input size.
		O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear
		complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space 
		complexity grows proportionally to
		the input size and a logarithmic factor</p>
